Gloo is a toolkit for building web applications and libraries with Rust and Wasm, composed of
modular crates. [Gloo crates](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/tree/master/crates)
include example code, both in their respective `example` folders, and commented in their code, as well
as [API documentation](https://docs.rs/gloo/).

5. [`history`](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-history)
6. [`net`](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-net)
7. [`render`](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-render)
8. [`storage`](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-storage)

10. [`utils`](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-utils)
11. [`worker`](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-worker)

## Using Gloo

Gloo is a *modular* toolkit: Each of its crates can either be used via the
umbrella `gloo` crate, which re-exports all of them for a stream-lined, holistic
experience, or each crate can be used independently.
