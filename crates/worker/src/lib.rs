//! Workers are a way to offload tasks to web workers. These are run concurrently using
//! [web-workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
//!
//! # Communicating with workers
//!
//! #### Bridges
//!
//! After a Worker is spawned, a bridge is created.
//! A Bridge allows bi-directional communication between an worker and a component.
//! Bridges also allow workers to communicate with one another.
//!
//! #### Scopes
//!
//! Scopes are used by workers to communicates with bridges and send updates to itself after
//! a task is finished.
//!
//! #### Overhead
//!
//! Gloo Workers use web workers. They incur a serialization overhead on the
//! messages they send and receive. Bridges use [bincode](https://github.com/servo/bincode)
//! by default to communicate with workers, so the cost is substantially higher
//! than just calling a function.
